# social-css-classes

A project to demonstrate the use of social media specific CSS classes

The traditioal HTML such as `<article> <section> <footer> <div> <header>` are indequate in tagging the vast varitey of content generated by users. Extending the tags, standardising them, implementation across the browsers is long and tedious process. The browser wars is eventually leading to fragmentation and polorization of web and sub standard content.

What if we leverage the power of CSS classes to tag the content? Using CSS classes for tagging content would give user maxium power and flexibility to mark up the content.

Let's, for example, take the below example. It consists of a post that has a certain structure tagged with CSS classes. These classes and content inside them can be read by the search engines, content aggregators, apps, AI/ML tools to create their own meta content to publish on their platforms. The existing social media apps can also access the content this way and push a meta content on their platforms that link to the original location of the post.

### Who will manage the CSS classes?

The list and the hierarchy of CSS classes will have to be publised by the content aggreators, search engine companies and app developers. For example, Facebook,Google or any new entity can ask the content creators to tag the posts with the classs names such as `fb-social-post` or `fb-social-summary`. Here is the demo ( https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-lrevjx?file=src%2FApp.js )

These classes are not standard CSS classes but followed as a convertion by differnet content aggregators.

### Goals

1. To promote equity, equality, equal opportunity on the web.
2. Promote quality content.
3. To create a level playing field for new social media networks and apps.
4. Structured web content.
5. Easy content discoverability, accessibility.

6) Wide reachability.

          By crawling the CSS classes and the content inside them, in a web
          page, search engines or social media apps, can generate their own
          syndicated content to be published on their own platform. The
          orgigianl content can be stored anywhere on the web by tagging it with
          appropriate social media CSS classes.
