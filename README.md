# social-css-classes

A project to demonstrate the use of social media specific CSS classes

The traditioal HTML tags like   asection> <footer> <div> <header> are indequate in tagging the vast varitey of content generated by users. Extending the tags, standardising the them, implementation across the browsers is very long and tedious process. The browser wars is eventually leading to fragmentation and polorization of web. Quality content on the web is loosing its shine to cheap content on the web.

What if we leverage the power of CSS classes to tag the content? Uisng CSS classes would give user the maxium power to tag the content. Let's for example, take the below example:

````
 <div class="social-post social-category-technology">
      <div class="social-heading">
        <h2> Wecome to the new web</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="social-summary">
        <p>
          Introducing a new paradigm for syndicating web content using social
          media spefic CSS classes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="social-img-carousel">
        <img src="https://dummyimage.com/300x200/5e2a0a/e9f266&text=Social+Media+CSS+Classes" />
        <img src="https://dummyimage.com/300x200/5e2a0a/e9f266&text=Social+Media+CSS+Classes" />
      </div>
      <div class="social-description">
        <p>
          By crawling the CSS classes and the content inside them, in a web
          page, search engines or social media apps, can generate their own
          syndicated content to be published on their own platform. The
          orgigianl content can be stored anywhere on the web by tagging it with
          appropriate social media CSS classes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="social-author-info">
        <p class="social-author"> Arun Kumar Kadari </p>
        <p class="social-date"> {new Date().toLocaleDateString()} </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    ```
